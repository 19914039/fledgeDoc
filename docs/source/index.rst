Welcome to fledge-IoT documentation!
===================================

**fledge-IoT** is a documentation guide for installing, setting up, and configuring the fledge and its associated plugins to use with various edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
Fledge project has its official documentation available at https://fledge-iot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. However, while building and using the fledge as per the official documentation, I came across a few errors, and there are some gaps in the documentation that will not completely explain to the very basic level. This guide is intended to fill that gap and share what I learned while working with Fledge. This explains at the basic level by keeping in mind that it would be helpful for the ones who want to start from very basic.

Check out the following: 

:doc:`Installation` section for the installation of Fledge by building it from the source code.

:doc:'Usecases' section for some of the use case scenarios for fledge deployment in the area of IoT and IIoT.

:doc:`Configure` section for the overview of different configurations available with fledge.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
